            In this class project, I was tasked with making an aggregator
            website--a website where users can select items out of a list and
            curate their own collection (think Amazon shopping cart or Pinterest
            pins). As a huge Genshin Impact fan, I immediately knew I wanted to
            make a website for keeping track of characters you have and want in
            the game!
            <a href="https://genshin-character-list.vercel.app/"
              >Here is the link.</a
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            To start, I analyzed the aggregation features of three existing
            websites and compared them.

      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>

      <div id="about-container" style="flex-direction: column">
        <div id="image-container">
          <img id="med-image" src="img/codibook.png" />
          <img id="med-image" src="img/pinterest.png" />
          <img id="med-image" src="img/twitter.png" />
        </div>
        <div id="about-text">
          <p>
            I chose three websites with aggregation features:
            <span><a href="https://codibook.net/">Codibook</a></span> (a Korean
            fashion retail website),
            <span><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a></span
            >, and <span><a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter.</a></span> To
            compare them, I made the following comparison chart:
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="image-container">
          <img
            style="width: 800px"
            src="img/comparison.png"
            alt="Competitive analysis chart"
          />
        </div>
        <p>
          In the competitive analysis, I noticed that each website had features
          that were streamlined for their purpose, resulting in pitfalls in
          other areas. For example, while Pinterest has a robust categorization
          system where users can curate boards with topics of their choice,
          <span style="font-weight: bold"
            >users aren't able to like something quickly in one click</span
          >--they have to choose a specific board to add it to. On the other
          hand, it's extremely easy to like a clothing item on Codibook since
          there is only one favorites list. This encourages users to like more
          items out of convenience, which is fitting for a clothing retail
          site--users will be more likely to buy items if it's very easy to save
          and view clothes that they like. The tradeoff is less customizability.
        </p>
        <div id="image-container">
          <img style="width: 300px" src="img/pinterest_save.png" alt="" />
          <img style="width: 350px" src="img/codibook_save.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <p>
          I additionally noticed that a
          <span style="font-weight: bold">grid view</span> was more effective
          than a list view in displaying likes--as an example, it was difficult
          to scroll through the list of likes on Twitter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I noticed that Twitter has a feature where you can
          <span style="font-weight: bold"
            >save something at varying degrees of importance:</span
          >
          it has both a normal "like" and a "bookmark," which implies more
          importance than a like. I felt that this feature struck a balance
          between convenience and curation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the features I felt were most important were the ability to
          quickly like and unlike in one click and having a grid view, while
          less relevant features (depending on the purpose of the website)
          included having a counter for the total number of likes.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="styleguide">
      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <div id="about-container" style="flex-direction: column">
        <div id="about-text">
          <p>
            Based on my competitive analysis, I wanted to implement the
            following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Some degree of user customization (whether this is a simple likes
              vs. bookmarks or a more robust categorization system)
            </li>
            <li>Sorting likes</li>
            <li>Grid view with images</li>
            <li>Like in one click</li>
            <li>Delete in one click</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I also noted that in all the websites I chose, the aggregator
            section was a separate page from the browsing section. In my app,
            they were on the same page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following my goal of making a Genshin Impact wishlist website, I
            included two categories of likes: a
            <span style="font-weight: bold">wishlist</span> and a
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >list of characters the user already owns.</span
            >
            Users can either click the heart or the checkbox on a character to
            add them to the respective list. You cannot add the same character
            to a list twice.
          </p>
          <div
            id="image-container"
            style="justify-content: center; align-items: center"
          >
            <img style="height: 300px" src="img/character.png" alt="" />
            <img style="width: 300px" src="img/lists.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            For my filtering and sorting functionality, I allowed the user to
            filter the list of characters by
            <span style="font-weight: bold">element type</span> (all characters
            have an element) and
            <span style="font-weight: bold">weapon type</span>. Users can sort
            the list alphabetically or by default, which will put 5-star
            characters first and 4-star characters later. The filters and sorts
            can be combined for more fine-grained searching. All buttons are
            toggle-able (i.e., you can reset a filter by clicking on an active
            button again).
          </p>
          <div
            id="image-container"
            style="
              justify-content: center;
              align-items: center;
              flex-direction: column;
            "
          >
            <img style="width: 500px" src="img/filter.png" alt="" />
            <img style="width: 500px" src="img/filter-2.png" alt="" />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

        <div id="about-text">
          <p>
            Looking back, I would've liked to experiment with more unique
            styling and CSS. While all the functionality is there, the website
            isn't too visually interesting or unique. I'd love to make it
            Genshin-themed!
          </p>
          <p>
            Some extra features I'd like to add include highlighting the heart
            and checkbox icons on character cards to show that they've already
            been added to the wishlist/owned list, as well as more filtering
            options (sorting by rarity).
